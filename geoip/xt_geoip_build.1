.SH Description
.PP
xt_geoip_build is used to build packed raw representations of the range
database that the xt_geoip module relies on. Since kernel memory is precious,
much of the preprocessing is done in userspace by this very building tool. One
file is produced for each country, so that no more addresses than needed are
required to be loaded into memory. The ranges in the packed database files are
also ordered, as xt_geoip relies on this property for its bisection approach to
work.
.PP
It expects to find a directory named
.IR GeoLite2-Country-CSV_YYYYMMDD
in the current directory, and will select the most recent if multiple
instances are found.  The
.IR xt_geoip_dl
script can be used to populate this directory.
.PP
Since the script is usually installed to the libexec directory of the
xtables-addons package and this is outside $PATH (on purpose), invoking the
script requires it to be called with a path.
.PP Options
.TP
\fB\-D\fP \fItarget_dir\fP
Specify a target directory into which the files are to be put.
.SH Application
