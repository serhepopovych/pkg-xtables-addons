.SH Syntax

\fI/usr/libexec/xt_geoip/\fP\fBxt_geoip_dl\fP
.SH Description
.PP
Downloads the DB-IP Country Lite databases for IPv4 and IPv6 and unpacks them
to the current directory. The alternate \fBxt_geoip_dl_maxmind\fP script can be
used for MaxMind formatted CSV databases.
.PP
Since the script is usually installed to the libexec directory of the
xtables-addons package and this is outside $PATH (on purpose), invoking the
script requires it to be called with a path.
